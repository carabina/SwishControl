SwishControl is a category on UIControl for adding sound effects to UIControlEvents.

## Usage

Import the SwishControl header
```objc
#import <SwishControl/SwishControl.h>
```
SwishControl uses AudioToolbox which supports aif, caf and wav.<br />
This is how you add a sound effect for all UIButtons
```objc
NSString *clickPath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"click" ofType:@"aif"];
[[UIButton appearance] bs_setAudioWithPath:clickPath forEvent:UIControlEventTouchUpInside];
```
Of course it can be applied to a single UIControl as well, if you don't want to set a sound for all of them.

## Requirements
iOS, bananas and a bunch of sound effects

## Installation

SwishControl is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "SwishControl"
```
